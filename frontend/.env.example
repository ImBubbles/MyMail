# Frontend Server Configuration
# Port for the frontend server (default: 3001 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS)
PORT=3001

# Enable HTTPS for the frontend
# Set to 'true' to enable HTTPS (requires certificates)
# For development, setting to 'true' without certificates will auto-generate self-signed certs
ENABLE_HTTPS=false

# HTTPS Certificate Configuration (optional, only needed if ENABLE_HTTPS=true)
# Paths are relative to the frontend directory
# For production, use proper SSL certificates from a Certificate Authority
# For development, you can generate self-signed certificates or use mkcert
HTTPS_KEY_PATH=./certs/key.pem
HTTPS_CERT_PATH=./certs/cert.pem

# Backend API Base URL
# Use either NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL (recommended) or API_BASE_URL
# If backend is also using HTTPS, use https:// instead of http://
NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
