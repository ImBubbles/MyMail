# Frontend Server Configuration
# Port for the frontend server (default: 3001 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS)
PORT=3001

# Enable HTTPS for the frontend
# Set to 'true' to enable HTTPS (REQUIRES certificate files)
# Certificate files must be provided - no auto-generation
ENABLE_HTTPS=false

# HTTPS Certificate Configuration (REQUIRED if ENABLE_HTTPS=true)
# Paths are relative to the frontend directory or absolute paths
# For production, use proper SSL certificates from a Certificate Authority
# Example: Generate self-signed certificates for development:
#   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout certs/key.pem -out certs/cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
HTTPS_KEY_PATH=./certs/key.pem
HTTPS_CERT_PATH=./certs/cert.pem

# Backend API Base URL
# Use either NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL (recommended) or API_BASE_URL
# If backend is also using HTTPS, use https:// instead of http://
# If not set, will auto-detect from current page location
NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
